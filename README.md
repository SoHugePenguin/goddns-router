# GoDDNS-Router

A lightweight DDNS updater written in Go, designed for embedded Linux routers such as **OpenWRT** and **iStoreOS-N100**.  
It currently supports **IPv6 only**, and updates records by identifying active local devices using their **MAC addresses** and **IPv6 neighbor table** (`ip -6 neigh`).

> üß† The tool is ideal for **router environments**. If run on a PC or VM, it can usually only update the DDNS for the **local machine itself**, due to limited access to neighbor entries.

## ‚ú® Features

- [x] ‚öôÔ∏è Zero-dependency binary for Linux (built with `CGO_ENABLED=0`)
- [x] üß© Supports Cloudflare DNS API
- [x] üì° Full IPv6 device discovery via `ip neigh` + MAC matching
- [x] üîÅ Suitable for periodic execution (e.g., via `crontab`)
- [x] üß† Simple JSON-based configuration
- [ ] üñ•Ô∏è Also usable on personal machines (e.g., DMZ server setup)

---

## üõ† Build (for Linux AMD64)

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o ddns-golang-app ./
```

## üöÄ Usage

- Copy the binary and a config.json file to your router or Linux server.

- Add a scheduled task to run the binary periodically (e.g., via crontab).

- Each execution will scan your LAN and update DNS records via Cloudflare.

## üìÑ config.json Example (multi-device)
```json
{
  "uniqueToken": "iStoreOS-N100",
  "cloudflareEmail": "your-cloudflare-email",
  "cloudflareApiKey": "your-cloudflare-api-key",
  "domainName": "your-cloudflare-domain-name",
  "localIpv4AddrApiUrl": "https://api-ipv4.ip.sb/ip",
  "localIpv6AddrApiUrl": "https://api-ipv6.ip.sb/ip",
  "recordMap": {
    "00:00:00:00:00:00": [
      {
        "name": "n100",
        "comment": "iStoreOS-N100 router"
      }
    ],
    "10:ff:e0:06:7d:f5": [
      {
        "name": "mz72",
        "comment": "PVE remote management"
      }
    ],
    "a0:36:9f:f7:f7:d5": [
      {
        "name": "pve",
        "comment": "Proxmox host"
      }
    ],
    "bc:24:11:40:47:48": [
      {
        "name": "virt210",
        "comment": "Windows Server 2022 - Penguin"
      }
    ],
    "bc:24:11:42:15:81": [
      {
        "name": "virt211",
        "comment": "Windows Server 2022 - XiaoYan"
      },
      {
        "name": "xiaoyan",
        "comment": "XiaoYan alias"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


## üñ•Ô∏è Minimal Config (Local-only DDNS)

- If you're only using this on a single device (e.g., your personal computer):

```json
{
  "uniqueToken": "my-computer001",
  "cloudflareEmail": "your-cloudflare-email",
  "cloudflareApiKey": "your-cloudflare-api-key",
  "domainName": "your-cloudflare-domain-name",
  "localIpv4AddrApiUrl": "https://api-ipv4.ip.sb/ip",
  "localIpv6AddrApiUrl": "https://api-ipv6.ip.sb/ip",
  "recordMap": {
    "00:00:00:00:00:00": [
      {
        "name": "your-name",
        "comment": "My computer"
      },
      {
        "name": "your-name2",
        "comment": "Alias name"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## üß† Notes

- MAC addresses are matched to IPv6 addresses via `ip -6 neigh`, so this tool requires access to your LAN's neighbor cache.
- This tool does not run as a daemon; each execution updates once and exits.
- Make sure Cloudflare API credentials have permissions to manage DNS records.
- All records updated are of type `AAAA` (IPv6).
